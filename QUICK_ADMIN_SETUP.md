# 🚀 Quick Admin Setup Guide

## ✅ **Admin Panel Access Control Fixed**

Your admin panel now properly restricts access to users with the `admin` role only. Here's how to set up your first admin user:

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Create Your User Account**
1. Go to your application (http://localhost:3000)
2. Click "Register" or "Sign Up"
3. Create an account with your email and password
4. Complete the registration process

### **Step 2: Run Admin Setup Script**
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `sql/admin_setup.sql`
3. Click **"Run"** to execute the script

### **Step 3: Make Your Account Admin**
In the same SQL Editor, run this command (replace with your email):

```sql
SELECT create_admin_user('your-email@example.com', 'Your Name');
```

### **Step 4: Verify Admin Access**
1. **Log out** and **log back in** to your application
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. You should now have full admin access! 🎉

## 🔧 **Alternative: Direct Database Update**

If you prefer to set up admin directly:

```sql
-- Find your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Update your profile to admin (replace USER_ID with your actual ID)
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin', updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = 'USER_ID';
```

## 🛡️ **What's Now Protected**

✅ **Admin Panel** (`/admin`) - Only admin users can access  
✅ **User Management** (`/admin/users`) - Only admins can view/edit users  
✅ **Species Management** (`/admin/species`) - Only admins can manage species  
✅ **Analytics** (`/admin/analytics`) - Only admins can view analytics  
✅ **All Admin Routes** - Protected by AdminGuard component  

## 🎯 **Admin Features Available**
