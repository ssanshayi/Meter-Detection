-- Simple RLS Fix - Allow Normal Access
-- =============================================================================

-- This script provides a simple fix that allows normal access
-- while avoiding the infinite recursion issue

-- 1. Remove all problematic policies

-- Remove all existing policies to start fresh

CREATE POLICY "projects_authenticated_write" ON conservation_projects FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- News articles: Allow read access to all, write access to authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "news_public_read" ON news_articles FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "settings_authenticated_write" ON system_settings FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- User favorites: Allow read access to own favorites, write access to authenticated users

CREATE POLICY "favorites_authenticated_write" ON user_favorites FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- 3. Test the fix
-- =============================================================================

-- Test that we can now query the profiles table
SELECT 'Testing profiles table access...' as test_message;
SELECT COUNT(*) as profiles_count FROM profiles;

-- Test that we can query marine_species table
SELECT 'Testing marine_species table access...' as test_message;
SELECT COUNT(*) as species_count FROM marine_species;

-- Test that we can query other tables
SELECT 'Testing other tables access...' as test_message;
SELECT COUNT(*) as tracking_count FROM species_tracking;
SELECT COUNT(*) as projects_count FROM conservation_projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) as news_count FROM news_articles;
SELECT COUNT(*) as resources_count FROM educational_resources;
